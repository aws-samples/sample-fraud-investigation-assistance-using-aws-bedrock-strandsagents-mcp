# Validate Merchant Contact Information Policy
**Date**: June 17, 2025 2:30pm

## Purpose
This policy outlines the process for validating merchant contact information against online sources.

## Intents
- Validate merchant online contact information
- Check merchant website legitimacy
- Validate merchant address consistency

## Procedure Steps
1. **Retrieve Merchant Metadata**
   - Use merchant support agent to get relevant merchant data.
   - Provide merchant ID to support agent.
   - Ask that the agent share the following, if available:
     - Website URL
     - Name
     - Phone number
     - Address
     - Email

2. **Website Validation and Contact Information Extractio**
   - Use online search suport agent and share the merchant website URL to be fetched.
   - If there is no merchant website URL, ask the support agent to search the merchant company name and pick a url that would sensibly be the website. Make sure the agent does not assume the email is the website.
   - Ask the online search support agent to parse the website, locate contact details section, and extract:
     - Phone number
     - Address
     - Email

3. **Cross Compare**
   - Share the contact information from the merchant support agent and the contact information from the online search support agent and provide any insight into inconsistencies.
